/*
 * This is the declaration of the Hand Class. 
 * It represents the data structure that each player will need in order to have cards.
 * It will be a vector of heads, with each vector array holding a different type of card.
 * So there will only be three array elements needed. 
 * Each part of the array will be pointing to a head node which will represent a LLL.
