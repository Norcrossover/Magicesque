/*
 * Magicesque is a game that is a parody of the game Magic. Therefore it is Magic -esque. Very very very simple version
 * of this complex game. I have never actually played the game personally, so I don't know if this is even close. 
 * This is a 2 player game that allows each player to have a hand of cards. At the start of the game, each player will be 
 * given a certain amount of cards. They will be received from the main Deck where all the cards come from like a classic
 * card game, which may be different than Magic. In addition to having a hand of cards, each player will also have health
 * points and mana. Some types of cards require mana in order to be used. Mana will be regained over each round. It is turn
 * based, meaning that each player will take turns playing cards each round, like Pokemon. I am still questioning if I 
 * want to have multiple cards per turn. Each round a player will draw a new card as well.
